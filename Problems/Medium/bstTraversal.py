# BINARY SEARCH TREE TRAVERSAL

create three functions that take in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an 
empty array , traverse the BST, add it's nodes values to the input
array, and then return that array. 

The functions should traverse the the BST using the in-order, 
pre-order, and post-order tree-traversal techniques, respectively.

class Solution:
    def inOrderTraverse(tree, array):
    

    def preOrderTraverse(tree, array):


    def postOrderTraversal(tree, array):
