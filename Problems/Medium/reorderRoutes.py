# Leetcode 1466

# Reorder routes to make all paths lead to city zero

# there are (n) cities numbered 0 to (n-1) and (n-1) roads such that
# there is only one way to travel between cities. 
# Last year, the ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction
# because they're too narrow. 

# Roads are represented by (connections) where connections[i] = [a ,b]
# represents a road from city (a) to (b).

# There's going to be a big event in (city 0) 

# your task consists of reorienting the roads so that each city can visit
# (city 0). Return the minimum number of edges changed.

# # it's guaranteed that each city can reach (city 0) after the reorder
