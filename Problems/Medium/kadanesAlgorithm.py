# KADANES ALGORITHM

# PROMPT

# Create a function that takes a non-empty array of integers and returns
# the maximum sum that can be obtained by summing up all of the integers 
# in a non-empty subarray of the input array.

# A subarray must only contain numbers that are adjacent to each other
# in the input array
