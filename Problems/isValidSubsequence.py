# Validate Subsequence

# Prompt:
    # Given two non-empty array of integers, create a function that 
    # determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the 
    # first one.

# Subsequence: a set of numbers that don't have to be adjacent in
# the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the 
# initial array.
