# HackerRank - Breaking Records

# Prompt

# Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. 
# Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the 
# number of times she breaks her season record for most points and 
# least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her 
# record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

        for i in range(1, len(array)):
            if minScore < scores[i]:

            elif maxScore > scores[i]:
            
        # return the min and maxCount's
